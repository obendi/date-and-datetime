# Using Date and DateTime with timezones

Example of using Date and DateTime with timezones in Java and HTML.

- Date will be represented with `java.time.LocalDate`.
- DateTime will be represented with `java.time.OffsetDateTime`.
- Datetimes are stored in UTC.

For the HTML frontend [Luxon](https://moment.github.io/luxon/) library is used to manage timezones.
